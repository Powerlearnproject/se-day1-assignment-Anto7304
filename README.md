Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing, buildind, testing, and maintaining software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Object Oriented Programming-it introduced the concept of objects with encapsulated data and methods, alllowing for code reuse, modularity, and easier development ofcomplex systems
Structured Programming- it had organized, modular code with clear control structures  nd enabling better readability and maintainability
Agile Development Methodologies- it emphasized iterative development with frequent feeedback loops, allowing for flexability in requirements and faster delivery compared to traditionalwaterfall models
Cloud computing- it is the ability to deploy and scale software application on remotes servers

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- it involves gathering the requirement from the client and documenting them
Design- it involves creating a blueprint for the software and the algorithm of the sofware 
Coding the software- this is translating the algorithm of the sofware into a language that a computer can unerstand
Testing- it is exercising the codes to see if they meet the requirement of the software
Implementation of the software- This is the installation of the software to the operating environment
Maintenance of the softawre- which involves the monitoring of the sofware and updating it in its life 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
comparison
waterfall mmethodologies is a linear progression through distinct phases like requirements  gathering, design, development,, testing, and deployment while Agile involves short iterattive cycles with continous feedback and adjustments
waterfall offers limited flexibility to change requirements once a phase is completed  while Agile encourages adapting to changing needs throughout the project
in waterfall customer feedback is typically gathered at the end of the project while the Agile emphasizes frequent customer interaction and feedback during each iteration
waterfall usually requires extensive upfront documentation while Agile prioritizes working software and may have less detailed documentation
waterfall methodology is used in 
-projects with well defined requirements and minimal expected changes
-projects where predictability and strict timelines are crucial
-projects with clear understanding of the scope and deliverables
Agile methodology is used in-
-projects with dynamic requiremnets that may change frequently
-projects where customers feedback is essential for succesful development 
-projects requiring rapid adaptation and flexibility to markret conditions

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
